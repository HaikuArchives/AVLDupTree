 *
 * This set of C subroutines is useful for indexing a set of key/value pairs,
 * using the key to find a matching value.  As an enhancement, multiple values
 * for the same key are supported efficiently.
 *
 * Copyright Â© 2001 by Alexander G. M. Smith.  Look a bit furthur down in
 * this file for licensing details (GNU Lesser General Public License).
 *
 * It's implemented with a balanced binary search tree, which lets you store
 * and find things in optimal O(log n) time.  A binary search tree (BST) has
 * the property that all nodes in the left sub-tree have keys less than the
 * given node, and all nodes in the right sub-tree have keys greater than the
 * given node.  Searching is done by just traversing down and choosing left or
 * right depending if the key you are looking for is less than or greater than
 * the current node's key.  The balancing is done by using the AVL algorithm,
 * which enforces the condition that left and right sub-trees differ in height
 * by at most one.  If an insert or delete operation (done much like a search -
 * except that you add the new node where the search said it should be) breaks
 * that rule, the subtrees are fixed up with a "BST rotation" operation, with
 * recursive fixups applied from the point of change all the way to the root if
 * necessary.  Since finding a key/value pair and the number of fixups for
 * insert/delete both depend on the height of the tree (which is O(log n)),
 * and a single fixup or search comparision takes constant time, the overall
 * speed of the basic find/insert/delete operations is O(log n).
 *
 * The AVL tree algorithms were invented by G. M. Adel'son-Velskii and
 * Y. M. Landis, who wrote about it first in 1962 in Soviet Math Dockl., titled
 * "An Algorithm for the Organization of Information".  I made use of a nice
 * article written by Timothy Rolfe on AVL trees in the December 2000 issue of
 * Dr. Dobb's Journal, pages 149-152.  I also dug up an alternate description
 * of AVL trees using "left heavy" and "right heavy" concepts in an old
 * textbook called "An Introduction to Data Structures with Applications", by
 * Jean-Paul Tremblay and P. G. Sorenson, 1976, McGraw-Hill computer science
 * series, pages 489-500.  They have a nice reference on page 519 to
 * Adel'son-Vel'skii, G. M. and E. M. Landis, same title as before, in
 * "Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Mathemat., vol. 146, no. 2, pp. 263-266, 1962."
 *
 * It's called AVLDupTree since it has been altered by Alexander G. M. Smith
 * to handle duplicate keys efficiently.  That was originally done by making a
 * subtree under the node with the common key to store the values.  But that
 * turned out to be unnecessarily complicated, just changing the key comparison
 * function solves the same problem - it now looks at the values if the keys
 * were equal.
 *
 * Since this is designed for use as the index for a BeOS inspired file system,
 * the keys can be the typical BeOS keys: string, int32, int64, float, double.
 *
 * It is also designed to work in a multitasking environment - allowing access
 * by multiple readers or a single writer (no, you can't have your reader's
 * callback function do a write operation - the write will deadlock waiting
 * for the number of readers to fall to zero).

a Right Rotation.  It's useful for balancing when the left subtree is deeper
than the right subtree.  It maintains the binary tree property (left is less,
right is greater) but doesn't maintain the AVL properties and may change the
height of the (sub)tree (the parent will need to recalculate its height;
however the heights of the nodes involved will be updated by this function).

The shuffle works like this: the left child becomes the root of the tree,
and since the old root was larger than the left child, it can be safely added
as the new right child of the new root.  So, what happens to the old right
child of the new root?  We know it is less than the old root, so we add it
as a left child of the old root (conveniently free because the left child
was moved up and become the new root).  The left child of the old left child

If you want to start at the beginning, pass in NULL for StartKeyPntr
(StartValuePntr will be ignored in that case).  Otherwise, when specifying a
non-NULL key, you can also pass in NULL for StartValuePntr if you want to
start at the lowest value available for the key (useful for iterating over all

key/value pair matching your starting key/value will be included in the

than your starting key/value.  Similarly you can use NULL for EndKeyPntr and
EndValuePntr and control equality with the ending key/value with
IncludeThingEqualToEnd.  One example: a full tree traversal can be done by
passing in NULL for both StartKeyPntr and EndKeyPntr (equality settings don't
matter).  Another example: for all values for a given key, pass in the same key
as StartKeyPntr and EndKeyPntr, and set StartValuePntr and EndValuePntr to
NULL.

While the iteration is proceeding, you can't modify the tree, so other threads
are only allowed to do read operations.  For that matter, your callback
function can't call routines which modify the tree either, or change the
key/value items it is passed.  If your callback function returns FALSE, then
the iteration will be stopped early.  ExtraUserData is also passed to your

/* Find a bunch of values given a key, or just get a count of the number of
values for a key.  Searches the tree and optionally fills in a user provided

You need to free any copied long strings in the things array (use
AVLDupFreeThingArray() to do it if the values are string type things).  You
can pass in zero for ArraySizeInThings if you just want to find out if a
particular key exists and how many values it has.  The pointers
NumberOfValuesActuallyInTree, NumberOfThingsReturnedInArray, ArrayOfThings can
be NULL and it will behave appropriately.  Returns FALSE if it runs out of
memory while making copies (will not return any values so you don't need to
worry about freeing partial allocations).  Returns TRUE in most other cases,
including when it doesn't find anything (*NumberOfValuesActuallyInTree will be
set to zero in that case). */
